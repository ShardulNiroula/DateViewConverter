# AdMob Integration Plan for DateViewConverter App

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to integrate Google AdMob into the DateViewConverter app (a Capacitor-based React app for timezones and clocks). The focus is on adding optional rewarded video ads to the "Support Us" page, allowing users to voluntarily watch ads to support the app. This approach avoids intrusive ads and aligns with user-driven monetization.

AdMob is chosen over alternatives like Unity Ads due to higher potential earnings, better global reach, and strong support for rewarded ads. No existing traffic is required to start; setup can begin immediately.

## Why AdMob?
- **Higher Earnings**: Generally offers better eCPM (effective cost per 1,000 impressions) compared to Unity Ads, especially for productivity/lifestyle apps like this one.
- **Rewarded Ads Fit**: Perfect for opt-in video ads on the Support Us page.
- **Global Reach**: Reliable ad fill rates and availability worldwide.
- **Capacitor Compatibility**: Easy integration via plugins like `@capacitor-community/admob`.

### Comparison with Unity Ads
- **Pay Difference**: AdMob often pays 20-50% more per impression in premium markets (e.g., US/EU). Unity Ads is competitive for gaming/non-gaming but lower overall.
- **Ease**: Unity Ads has simpler onboarding; AdMob requires more verification but higher rewards.
- **Best For**: AdMob for max earnings; Unity Ads as a backup or for easier start.

## Criteria and Requirements for Using AdMob
You must meet these to sign up and earn. No traffic needed for setup.

## Setup Steps
1. **Sign Up**: Go to https://admob.google.com and create an account.
2. **Create App**: Add your app (select Android), get Ad Unit IDs (e.g., for Rewarded Video).
3. **Integrate SDK**: Install `@capacitor-community/admob` plugin in your project.
4. **Test Ads**: Use test Ad Unit IDs to verify without real earnings.
5. **Publish App**: Submit to Google Play; link accounts for payouts.
6. **Monitor**: Use AdMob dashboard for performance.

## Integration for Rewarded Video Ads
- **Plugin**: `@capacitor-community/admob` (install via npm).
- **Code Changes**:
  - In Support Us page (e.g., `src/pages/supportUs/SupportUs.jsx`), add a button: "Watch Ad to Support Us".
  - On click, call AdMob API to show rewarded video.
  - After completion, show thank-you message.
- **Example Flow**:
  1. User taps button.
  2. Check ad availability.
  3. Show video ad.
  4. Reward: "Thanks for supporting us!"
- **Testing**: Use test IDs; ensure no policy violations.

## Monetization Tips
- **Start Small**: Test with real users post-launch.
- **Optimize**: Place ads in high-engagement areas; track via dashboard.
- **Hybrid**: Use AdMob primarily; add Unity Ads as fallback.
- **User Experience**: Keep ads optional; monitor feedback.
- **Earnings Estimate**: 10,000 impressions might yield $10-50 (AdMob) vs. $5-15 (Unity).

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
- **Account Suspension**: Violate policies â†’ review and fix.
- **Low Fill Rates**: Use mediation for multiple networks.
- **Legal Issues**: Update privacy policy; consult lawyer if needed.
